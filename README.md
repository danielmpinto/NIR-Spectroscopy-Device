# NIR-Spectroscopy-Device

Part of the undergraduate thesis in Control and Automation Engineering - [Faculdade Salvador Arena](https://faculdadesalvadorarena.org.br/site/).


At this stage,  this work have made two working devices for measuring glucose through NIRS method.

We obtained good results with the second device (B), but the prototype A wasn't good in initial testing.



Prototype B - Clarke Error Grid
